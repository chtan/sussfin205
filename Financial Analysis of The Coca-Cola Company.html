<p>One should remember these points about an analysis when embarking on constructing one:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The purpose of an analysis includes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for understanding of the financial situation of a company, which support downstream responses to queries on the subject</p></li>
<li><p>for communication</p></li>
<li><p>as basis for further analysis or decision making</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>complex analysis may be structured</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to have parts</p></li>
<li><p>each part comprises the piecing together of a myriad low level analysis items</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>one or more questions may guide the entire analysis, or parts of it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One should also be cognizant of the distinction between financial analysis and business analysis which are related.</p>
<div class="note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">How are financial analysis and business analysis related?</p>
<p>Financial analysis and business analysis are two distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the realm of business management. While they both involve examining various aspects of a company, they focus on different areas and serve different purposes. Here’s a comparison and contrast between the two:</p>
<p><strong>Financial Analysis:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Focus</strong>: Financial analysis primarily concentrates on assessing a company’s financial health and performance by analyzing its financial statements, ratios, and metrics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary purpose of financial analysis is to evaluate the company’s financial strengths, weaknesses, profitability, liquidity, solvency, and overall financial stability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong>: Financial analysts use tools such as financial ratios (liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, etc.), trend analysis, cash flow analysis, and comparative analysis to evaluate financial performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: Financial analysis heavily relies on historical financial data, including income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stakeholders</strong>: Financial analysis is crucial for investors, creditors, financial institutions, and other stakeholders interested in the company’s financial performance and stability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Business Analysis:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Focus</strong>: Business analysis involves examining various aspects of a business, including its processes, operations, strategies, market position, competitors, customers, and stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary purpose of business analysis is to identify business needs, opportunities, and problems and propose solutions to help the company achieve its objectives and improve its overall performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong>: Business analysts use tools such as SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), PESTLE analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental), market research, competitor analysis, and business process modeling to understand the business environment and make informed decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: Business analysis requires a wide range of data sources, including market research reports, industry benchmarks, customer feedback, internal operational data, and external economic indicators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stakeholders</strong>: Business analysis is essential for various stakeholders, including business owners, executives, managers, and employees, as it helps in strategic planning, decision-making, and operational improvements.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Focus</strong>: Both financial analysis and business analysis aim to provide insights into different aspects of a company’s performance and operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interconnectedness</strong>: Financial analysis is a subset of business analysis, as financial health is one aspect of overall business performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decision Making</strong>: Both disciplines play a crucial role in decision-making processes within an organization, albeit from different perspectives.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Scope</strong>: Financial analysis focuses specifically on financial data and metrics, whereas business analysis encompasses a broader range of factors beyond finances, including market dynamics, operational efficiency, and strategic positioning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Financial analysis primarily aims to assess financial performance and stability, while business analysis aims to understand the entire business ecosystem and identify opportunities for improvement and growth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong>: While both disciplines use analytical tools, the specific tools and techniques employed differ based on their respective focuses and objectives.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, financial analysis and business analysis are complementary disciplines that provide different perspectives on a company’s performance and operations. While financial analysis delves into the company’s financial health and stability, business analysis takes a broader view, examining various internal and external factors impacting the business’s overall performance and competitiveness.</p>

<h2>The Background on The Coca-Cola Company<a class="headerlink" href="#the-background-on-the-coca-cola-company" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<section id="brief-history">
<h3>Brief History<a class="headerlink" href="#brief-history" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the bustling city of Atlanta, Georgia, in the year 1886, a humble pharmacist named Dr. John Pemberton was toying with an intriguing concoction in his laboratory. Little did he know that his experimentation would birth one of the world’s most iconic beverages - Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Pemberton, seeking to create a refreshing tonic, blended together a unique mixture of coca leaf extract and kola nut. This combination yielded a fizzy elixir that tantalized the taste buds and invigorated the senses. Intrigued by his creation, Pemberton decided to share it with the world.</p>
<p>Enter Asa Candler, a savvy businessman with an eye for opportunity. Sensing the potential of Pemberton’s creation, Candler acquired the formula in 1888, marking the dawn of a new era for Coca-Cola. With Candler at the helm, the drink underwent a transformation, evolving from a local curiosity into a nationwide sensation.</p>
<p>Candler’s shrewd marketing strategies propelled Coca-Cola to unprecedented heights. Through innovative advertising and strategic partnerships, he ensured that the iconic red-and-white logo became a ubiquitous symbol of refreshment and enjoyment.</p>
<p>But Coca-Cola’s journey didn’t stop at the borders of the United States. With an ambitious vision for global expansion, the company ventured into international markets, adapting its recipe and marketing tactics to suit diverse cultures and tastes. From the bustling streets of New York City to the bustling markets of Tokyo, Coca-Cola’s effervescent charm knew no bounds.</p>
<p>Throughout the 20th century, Coca-Cola continued to evolve, diversifying its product lineup and acquiring beloved brands such as Minute Maid and Powerade. Despite facing challenges ranging from changing consumer preferences to health concerns, the company remained resilient, embracing innovation and adaptation at every turn.</p>
<p>Beyond business success, Coca-Cola also embraced its role as a corporate citizen, championing causes such as environmental sustainability and community development. Through initiatives like water conservation and youth empowerment programs, the company sought to leave a positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>Today, The Coca-Cola Company stands as a testament to the power of innovation, perseverance, and the simple joy of a refreshing beverage. From its humble origins in a small Atlanta pharmacy to its status as a global icon, Coca-Cola’s journey is a story of imagination, determination, and the enduring spirit of refreshment.</p>

<p>In addition to its core beverage offerings, Coca-Cola has ventured into new territories, including the production of alcoholic beverages in select markets, further diversifying its portfolio to meet the evolving needs of consumers. Beyond product manufacturing, the company operates an extensive distribution and bottling network globally, ensuring efficient delivery of its beverages to consumers through various channels, from traditional retail outlets to vending machines and e-commerce platforms.</p>

<h2>Competition and Strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#competition-and-strategy" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<section id="competition">
<h3>Competition<a class="headerlink" href="#competition" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company encounters competition from a diverse array of rivals, both domestically within the United States and on a global scale. Domestically, within the U.S., it faces its primary competitor, PepsiCo, which offers a range of soft drinks such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Sierra Mist, along with a variety of snacks and beverages. Additionally, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group (now Keurig Dr Pepper) competes in the carbonated soft drink market with brands like Dr Pepper, 7UP, and Snapple. Moreover, Coca-Cola contends with smaller, regional brands that cater to specific local tastes and preferences across the country.</p>
<p>On a global level, Coca-Cola faces competition from multinational corporations such as Nestlé, which produces bottled water (e.g., Pure Life), juices (e.g., Nestea), and other beverages, directly challenging Coca-Cola’s offerings. Red Bull, a major competitor in the energy drink segment, competes with Coca-Cola’s brands like Monster Energy and Powerade. Additionally, companies like Starbucks Corporation, with its extensive coffee shop network and ready-to-drink coffee products, and local and regional beverage brands worldwide, pose significant competition to Coca-Cola’s market share in various regions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rise of health and wellness trends presents competition from companies offering healthier beverage options such as sparkling water brands (e.g., LaCroix, Perrier) and natural juices. Technological advancements and innovations also indirectly impact Coca-Cola’s competitiveness, with emerging trends like at-home soda machines, subscription services, and mobile ordering platforms changing traditional beverage consumption patterns.</p>
<p>In essence, Coca-Cola navigates a fiercely competitive landscape, both locally within the U.S. and globally, where it must continually innovate and adapt to remain at the forefront of consumer preferences and maintain its market leadership.</p>

<section id="strategy">
<h3>Strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#strategy" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The company’s strategy revolves around several key pillars aimed at driving growth and resilience amidst challenges. It emphasizes brand portfolio optimization, reducing from 400 to 200 master brands to focus on those with the highest growth potential. A networked organization structure fosters collaboration and efficiency, while marketing efforts prioritize personalized consumer engagement and disciplined resource allocation. Innovation is approached strategically, with a focus on incremental growth and scalability. The digital strategy integrates online and offline experiences, leveraging data for improved execution. Revenue growth management is central to identifying opportunities and strategies, with digital capabilities enhancing decision-making. Success is ultimately dependent on system-wide execution, with strategic partnerships and operational transformations yielding positive results across markets.</p>

<section id="profitability">
<h2>Profitability<a class="headerlink" href="#profitability" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Profitability analysis is performed by calculating profitability ratios and interpreting them. It is employed to evaluate how effectively a company can produce profits in comparison to its revenue, operational expenses, assets on its balance sheet, or shareholders’ equity across a period of time.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of probability ratios - those that are based on margin and those that are based on return. As a ratio cannot be read alone, these ratios must be computed over several years of history, and for at least another company.</p>
<section id="ratio-analysis">
<h3>Ratio Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#ratio-analysis" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the following, we will look at the profitability ratios of The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, Inc. FY2019-2023, and interpret them. After that, we will relate the results to the reported actions of the company.</p>

<p>Recall that while Gross profit margin focuses solely on production efficiency and pricing, net profit margin offers a broader perspective on overall profitability, encompassing all aspects of a company’s operations.</p>
<p>The gross profit margin of The Coca-Cola Company (abbrev. Coke) is consistenly about 5 points higher than that of Pepsi. The two companies have maintained this margin consistently about a mean of 59.61 and 54.28 respectively.</p>
<p>The net profit margin of Coke fluctuates about a mean of 23.72 while that of Pepsi does so about the 10.31 level. Thus, Coke’s net profit margin is consistenly about 13 points above Pepsi’s. This is the evidential crux pointing to the leadership of Coke in the global beverage industry.</p>
<p>During the Covid-19 period, there was no discernible impact on the margins, indicating the beverage industry’s resilience to economic downturns.</p>
<p>ROA reflects the company’s efficiency in utilizing all its resources to generate profit, while ROE emphasizes the return generated specifically from shareholders’ investments, making it a measure of shareholders’ profitability.</p>
<p>The ROA of Coke has a mean of 11.07. After a dip of about 1 point from 2019 to 2020, it has been on a rising trend, reaching 12.24 in 2023. Pepsi has been showing a similar pattern with ROA, with a mean of 9.89 and a level of 10.93 in 2023. The ROA of Coke is consistenly about 1 point higher than that of Pepsi. Thus, the ROA numbers suggest that both companies have been able to maintain and improve the efficiency in utilizing its resources to generate profit.</p>
<p>The ROE of the two companies fluctuate over the period. The lowest value of 40.48 for Coke occurred in 2020, while that for Pepsi occurred in 2019 at 49.86. The highest value of ROE for Coke is 49.86 which occurred in 2019, while for Pepsi, it is 54.21 which occurred in 2022. The spread was more than 9 points for Coke over the 5-year period, while it was about 4.5 for Pepsi. The ROE of Pepsi is consistenly higher than that of Coke.</p>
<p>The analysis above shows that both companies are able to produce profits stably over time. Of the 4 ratios considered, only the ROA shows some appreciable fluctuations. Coke generally outperforms Pepsi with respect to the gross profit margin, the net profit margin and the ROA. In particular, its net profit margin is about twice of Pepsi’s. On the other hand, Pepsi outperforms Coke in terms of profitability relative to shareholders’ equity.</p>
<p>Coke’s strategy of brand portfolio optimization, marketing prioritizing personalized consumer engagement and integration of digital strategy may be factors for its superior profitability performance.</p>

<h3>MDA Review<a class="headerlink" href="#mda-review" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review what the management says about its operations in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Item 7 of 10-K FY2023).</p>
<p>Management indicates several key points regarding the company’s profitability:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> The gross profit margin increased to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. Management attributes this increase primarily to favourable pricing initiatives, favourable channel and package mix, and structural changes. However, this increase was partially offset by unfavourable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating Income and Operating Margin:</strong> Operating income increased to $11,311 million in 2023 from $10,909 million in 2022, representing a 4% increase. However, the consolidated operating margin decreased to 24.7% in 2023 from 25.4% in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher other operating charges, and the unfavourable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Despite the decrease in operating margin, the company experienced growth in operating income due to concentrate sales volume growth and favourable pricing initiatives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equity Income:</strong> Equity income increased to $1,691 million in 2023 from $1,472 million in 2022, reflecting more favourable operating results from equity method investees and a favourable foreign currency exchange rate impact. This increase was partially offset by higher net charges from certain equity method investees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Income (Loss):</strong> Other income in 2023 was $570 million, compared to a loss of $262 million in 2022. The increase in other income was primarily driven by gains related to the refranchising of bottling operations, gains from equity securities, dividend income, and income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost. However, this increase was partially offset by net foreign currency exchange losses and impairment charges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Income Taxes:</strong> The effective tax rate for the company was 17.4% in 2023, compared to 18.1% in 2022. The lower effective tax rate primarily resulted from income tax incentive grants received in certain jurisdictions and benefits from earnings generated in equity method investments.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, while the company experienced growth in operating income and equity income, it faced challenges such as increased commodity costs, higher operating expenses, and unfavourable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which impacted its operating margin. However, effective tax management and gains from other income sources contributed positively to the company’s profitability.</p>

<h2>Cash<a class="headerlink" href="#cash" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Analysis of cash is also known as liquidity analysis. This evaluates the ability of a company or individual to meet short-term financial obligations using its available liquid assets.</p>
<section id="id1">
<h3>Ratio Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The current and quick ratios will be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Recall that the current ratio compares a company’s current assets to its current liabilities. It measures the ability of a company to pay its short-term obligations using its short-term assets. A higher current ratio indicates better liquidity. The quick ratio is similar, differing in that inventory is removed from current assets as it may not be easily convertible into cash. It provides a more conservative measure of liquidity.</p>

<p>The trajectory of these ratios for the two companies display a similar pattern. Over the Covid-19 years of 2019 - 2020, each ratio dips down. The it rises in 2021. A period of moderate fluctuation follows.  This rise from 2020 to 2021 is more significant for the current ratio than the quick ratio.</p>
<p>This suggests that initially when the pandemic struck, the companies’ liquidity was reduced. This was reversed as they emerge from the period, appreciably increased their inventory.</p>
<p>Both ratios for Coke were lower than Pepsi’s in from 2019 to 2020. This was turned around from 2021 to 2023, indicating a marked improvement in liquidity for Coke.</p>
<p>The reduction of master brands in its portfolio optimization effort may be a factor as expenses might have been reduced as a result.</p>

<h3>MDA Review<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In terms of liquidity, the management asserts the company’s robust ability to generate cash flows from operating activities as a fundamental strength. They highlight the company’s reliance on debt financing instead of stock issuance to lower the overall cost of capital and enhance return on shareowners’ equity. The company’s history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates is cited, with an expectation to continue borrowing at such rates in the long term. The presence of cash reserves, short-term investments, marketable securities, and unused backup lines of credit amounting to $13.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, further underscores the company’s liquidity position. Additionally, the management discusses payment terms with suppliers, the availability of a voluntary supply chain finance program, and a trade accounts receivable factoring program. Despite ongoing litigation with the IRS, the company expresses confidence in its liquidity position, deeming it strong enough to fund operating activities and commitments for investing and financing activities in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>Risk<a class="headerlink" href="#risk" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The company faces a myriad of risks spanning economic, competitive, and regulatory domains. Economic and geopolitical uncertainties, including global downturns and political instability, can dampen consumer confidence and demand. Intense competition within the beverage industry necessitates continuous innovation and strategic pricing to maintain market share and profitability. Moreover, expansion into emerging markets poses challenges such as economic instability and cultural differences, requiring careful localization and adaptation strategies. Supply chain disruptions, driven by factors like commodity price volatility and transportation issues, may disrupt operations and increase costs. Additionally, regulatory and legal uncertainties, especially concerning taxation and compliance, present significant financial and operational risks. Health concerns and changing consumer preferences towards healthier or environmentally sustainable products could impact demand, while cybersecurity threats and data privacy compliance risks require ongoing vigilance and investment in security measures. Lastly, environmental and social factors such as sustainability compliance and plastic pollution may affect brand reputation and market acceptance. Overall, proactive risk management and strategic adaptation are crucial for navigating these complex challenges and sustaining growth in the dynamic beverage industry landscape.</p>
<p>The risks of The Coca-Cola Company may be found described in detail as Item 1A in its 10-K filing FY2023. Here is a summary:</p>
