Act&#148;). The Adviser, a Delaware limited partnership and subsidiary of 26North Partners LP, serves as our investment adviser and is responsible for portfolio and risk management of the Company. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of
directors (the &#147;Board of Directors&#148;), the Adviser manages our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT> operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us. We also
intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a BDC and a RIC, we will be required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. See

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We invest primarily in directly originated senior
secured loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States. The Company&#146;s portfolio will consist primarily of direct originations of (i)&nbsp;first lien senior secured debt and unitranche debt (including last out portions of such
loans) and, to a lesser extent, (ii)&nbsp;second lien senior secured debt and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt. In connection with its debt investments, the Company is permitted to receive equity warrants or make select equity <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-investments.</FONT> We generally consider middle market companies to consist of companies with between $25&nbsp;million and $100&nbsp;million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation
and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;), although the Company may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we invest primarily in
middle market companies domiciled in the United States, we also may from time to time invest, to a lesser extent, in companies domiciled outside of the United States (subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70% of our assets
in United States companies). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To achieve our investment objective, we will leverage the experience, talent and extensive network of relationships of
26North&#146;s investment personnel (the &#147;Investment Team&#148;) to source and evaluate opportunities. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objective. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently intend to list our shares of Common Stock on a national securities exchange (an &#147;Exchange Listing&#148;) as determined by the Adviser in its
sole discretion within seven years of the Reorganization (as defined below), which was effected on October&nbsp;2, 2023, subject to market conditions. We also may pursue one or more liquidity events within seven years of the Reorganization, as
determined by the Adviser in its sole discretion, including: (i)&nbsp;to commence a share repurchase program in which we repurchase a portion of our Common Stock on a periodic basis at a purchase price equal to our net asset value per share;
(ii)&nbsp;a merger or other transaction in which Stockholders receive cash or shares of a listed company; (iii)&nbsp;a sale of all or substantially all of our assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually to an unaffiliated third party
or an affiliate followed by liquidation; and/or (iv)&nbsp;an orderly wind down and/or liquidation (including an Exchange Listing, each, a &#147;Liquidity Event&#148;). There can be no assurance that any Liquidity Event will occur. In light of the
illiquid nature of our portfolio, a sale of assets by the Company to an affiliate likely would be predicated upon the Company obtaining exemptive and/or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">no-action</FONT> relief from the SEC; however, there can be no
assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such exemptive and/or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">no-action</FONT> relief from the SEC. </P>

loss in that calendar quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. In addition, because the Hurdle Amount is calculated based on our net assets, decreases in our net assets due to realized or unrealized capital losses may increase the
likelihood that the Hurdle Amount is reached and therefore the likelihood of us paying an Incentive Fee in a given calendar quarter. In addition, if market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for
a higher return, which would increase our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Pre-Incentive</FONT> Fee Net Investment Income and make it easier for the Adviser to surpass the fixed Hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment
income. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the Management Fee because gross assets are total assets (including cash received) before

Subscription Agreements with a number of investors providing for the private placement of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Private Offering and intend to enter into additional Subscription Agreements from time to time. Each investor makes a
Capital Commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Subscription Agreement. Investors are required to make capital contributions to purchase shares of Common Stock each time we deliver a drawdown notice, which are issued based on our
anticipated investment activities and capital needs, in an aggregate amount not to exceed each investor&#146;s respective Capital Commitment. We will deliver each drawdown notice at least ten days prior to the required funding date. All purchases of
Common Stock will generally be made pro rata in accordance with remaining Capital Commitments of all investors, at a per share price equal to the net asset value per share of Common Stock subject to any adjustments. Any adjustments would take into
account a determination of changes to net asset value within 48 hours of the sale to assure compliance with Section&nbsp;23(b) of the 1940 Act. At the earlier of an Exchange Listing and the end of the Fundraising Period, however, Stockholders will
be released from any further obligation to fund drawdowns and purchase additional shares, although the Stockholders will remain obligated to fund drawdowns to the extent necessary to pay Company expenses, complete investments in certain
transactions, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</FONT> investments, fund any guaranteed obligations and/or as necessary for the Company to preserve its tax status (&#147;Permitted Uses&#148;); <I>provided</I> that any Stockholder

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(x)&nbsp;one-year</FONT> anniversary of such Stockholder&#146;s initial Capital Commitment and (y)&nbsp;expiration of the Fundraising Period, unless an Exchange Listing were to occur prior thereto. The &#147;Fundraising
Period&#148; will continue from the commencement of the Company&#146;s investment operations until the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-year</FONT> anniversary thereof, subject to two additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-year</FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted an &#147;opt out&#148; distribution reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our Stockholders, unless
a Stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then Stockholders who do not &#147;opt out&#148; of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their
cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock, rather than receiving cash distributions. Investors can elect to &#147;opt out&#148; of our distribution reinvestment plan in their Subscription Agreements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There will be no brokerage charges or other charges to Stockholders who participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. The plan administrator&#146;s fees

consequences as are Stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash. However, since a participating Stockholder&#146;s cash distributions will be reinvested, such Stockholder will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes
on reinvested distributions. A Stockholder&#146;s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a distribution from us will generally be equal to the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to the Stockholder. Any
stock received in a distribution will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. Stockholder&#146;s account. </P>

the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by
reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Adviser will subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3

U.S. Government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase
by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest
rate. Consequently, repurchase agreements are functionally similar to loans. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, the 1940 Act and certain diversification
tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess
of this limit. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we may enter into repurchase agreement transactions. </P>

restrictions on the issuance, terms and amount of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i)&nbsp;the warrants
expire by their terms within ten years, (ii)&nbsp;the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii)&nbsp;Stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and the Board of Directors
approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in our and the Stockholders&#146; best interests and (iv)&nbsp;if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such
warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Senior Securities; Asset Coverage Ratio </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to the Common Stock if our
asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset
coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. This means that generally, we can borrow up to $1 for every $1 of investor equity (or, if certain requirements are met, we can borrow up to $2 for every $1
of investor equity). On September&nbsp;6, 2023, the Adviser, as our sole initial Stockholder, approved a proposal that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and, in connection with their Subscription Agreements, our investors are
required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, while any senior securities remain
outstanding, we would be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to Stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless it meets the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution
or repurchase. We would also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. </P>

Stock. This discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, this Annual Report does not describe tax consequences that we have assumed to be generally known by
investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including persons who hold the Common Stock as part of a straddle or a hedging, integrated or
constructive sale transaction, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> organizations, insurance companies, brokers or dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, persons whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, personal holding companies, persons who acquire an interest in us in connection with the performance of services, and
financial institutions. Such persons are urged to consult with their tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in us, which may differ substantially from those described herein. This summary assumes that
Stockholders hold the Common Stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial
interpretations, each as of the date of this Annual Report and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) regarding any matter discussed herein. Prospective investors should be aware that, although we intend to adopt positions we believe are in accord with current interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax
laws, the IRS may not agree with the tax positions taken by us and that, if challenged by the IRS, our tax positions might not be sustained by the courts. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate, alternative minimum, or gift tax or
foreign, state or local tax. It also does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> securities or certain other investment assets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The discussion generally describes the tax consequences to investors of certain likely investments assuming that they are held by the Company directly or
through subsidiaries that are transparent, <I>i.e.</I>, disregarded or treated as partnerships, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including entities that engage in investment activities in securities or other assets that are primarily controlled
by the Company. The Company will comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act governing investment policies, capital structure, and leverage on an&nbsp;aggregate basis with such subsidiary. Each such subsidiary will also be subject to the
Company&#146;s compliance policies and procedures, including compliance with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act relating to affiliated transactions. U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as custodian for the assets of the Company
held by 26N DL Funding 1 LLC (the &#147;Financing SPV&#148;), a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company. To the extent the Company forms additional wholly owned subsidiaries, the assets of the Company held by those subsidiaries would be
custodied in compliance with Section&nbsp;17(g) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder. Each such subsidiary will not engage in active portfolio management, and all collateral held by such subsidiary is consistent with the principal investment
strategies and principal risks of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company, however, may in the future hold at least some investments through subsidiaries that are not
transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company may choose (but is not required) to hold investments through a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transparent</FONT> subsidiary in order to address 1940 Act issues, prevent Stockholders
from having to file state tax returns in a state in which the Company otherwise might have a taxable presence, block &#147;unrelated business taxable income&#148; for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> Stockholders, avoid causing the
Company or Stockholders to have tax filing and payment obligations in jurisdictions outside the United States, or for other reasons. Some <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transparent</FONT> subsidiaries, e.g., U.S. corporate subsidiaries, may
involve subsidiary-level tax leakage and, under current law, tax benefits for certain Stockholders. The use of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transparent</FONT> subsidiaries may also affect whether the Company is engaged in business with
respect to particular investments, which can affect taxation of Stockholders. The Adviser, in its sole discretion, will determine whether to hold particular investments through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transparent</FONT> subsidiaries.

given year exceed investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset
investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may, for tax purposes, have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our
Stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or
losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, a Stockholder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than it would have received in the absence of such transactions. </P>

following considerations, along with the other information in this Annual Report, should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in our Common Stock. The risks set forth below are not the only risks we face, and we may face other risks
that we have not yet identified or which we do not currently deem material. If any of those risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the net asset

based on the amount of proceeds raised in our initial closing or subsequent closings that it could take some time to invest substantially all of the capital we expect to raise due to market conditions generally and the time necessary to identify,
evaluate, structure, negotiate and close suitable investments in private middle market companies. In order to comply with the RIC diversification requirements during the startup period, we may invest proceeds in temporary investments, such as cash,
cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the time of investment, which we expect will earn yields substantially lower than the interest, dividend or other income that
we seek to receive in respect of suitable portfolio investments. Distributions paid during this period may be substantially lower than the distributions we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested. We will pay the Management Fee to the
Adviser throughout this interim period irrespective of our performance. If the Management Fee and our other expenses exceed the return on the temporary investments, our equity capital will be reduced. If we do not produce positive investment

subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways

company investments may make it difficult or impossible for us to sell investments if the need arises. Many of these investments will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than exchange-listed
securities or other securities for which there is an active trading market. We typically would be unable to exit these investments unless and until the portfolio company has a liquidity event such as a sale, maturity, refinancing, or initial public
offering. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, investments purchased by us that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer, market events, economic conditions or investor

obligations and, to the extent that we cannot, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our asset coverage ratio were to fall below 150% (or 200%, as applicable), we could not incur additional debt and may need to sell a portion of our
investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations and investment activities. Moreover, our ability to make distributions to you may be significantly restricted or we may
not be able to make any such distributions at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to having fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our

our right to call unused Capital Commitments from the Stockholders. If we enter into a subscription credit facility, the lenders (or their agent) may have the right on behalf of us to directly call unused Capital Commitments and enforce remedies

in some cases, result in an event of default. An event of default could result in an accelerated maturity date for all amounts outstanding thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could lead

Facility are, and any additional credit facilities or other borrowings may be, secured by a pledge of and a security interest in some or all of our assets, including our portfolio of investments and cash. If we default, we may be forced to sell a

markets and the broader economy. In an attempt to stabilize inflation, governments may impose wage and price controls or otherwise intervene in a country&#146;s economy. Governmental efforts to curb inflation, including by increasing interest rates
or reducing fiscal or monetary stimuli, often have negative effects on the level of economic activity. Certain countries, including the U.S., recently have experienced increased levels of inflation, and persistently high levels of inflation could
have a material and adverse impact on the Company&#146;s investments and its returns. For example, if a portfolio company were unable to increase its revenue while the portfolio company&#146;s cost of relevant inputs was increasing, the portfolio
company&#146;s profitability likely would suffer, which may impact returns on our investment therein. Likewise, to the extent a portfolio company has revenue streams that are slow or unable to adjust to changes in inflation, including by contractual
arrangements or otherwise, the portfolio company could increase revenue by less than its expenses increase. Conversely, as inflation declines, a portfolio company may see its competitors&#146; costs stabilize sooner or more rapidly than its own.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because we anticipate that we will borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at
which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. Rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield. As a
result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Trading prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return tend to fall as interest rates rise and trading prices tend to fluctuate more for fixed-rate
securities that have longer maturities. An increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In periods of rising interest rates, to the extent we borrow money subject to a floating interest rate, our
cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with floating interest rates, subject to specified minimum interest rates
(such as a&nbsp;Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#147;SOFR&#148;) floor), while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to floating interest rates not subject to such minimums. In such a scenario, rising interest rates may increase our
interest expense, even though our interest income from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner as a result of such minimum interest rates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If interest rates rise, there is a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating interest
amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on
their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may enter into certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate
swap agreements, in an effort to mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and we may increase our floating rate investments to position the portfolio for rate increases. However, we cannot assure you that such transactions
will be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk or if we will enter into such interest rate hedges. Hedging transactions may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our
portfolio investments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may enter into hedging transactions, which may expose us to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts,
currency options and interest rate swaps to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Use of these hedging instruments may include
counterparty credit risk. The fair value (rather than the notional value) of any derivatives or swaps we enter into will be included in our calculation of gross assets for purposes of calculating the Management Fee. Additionally, derivatives and
swaps will be accounted for as realized or unrealized gains (losses) for accounting purposes and could impact the portion of the incentive fee based on realized capital gains. As a result, any derivatives we enter into that result in realized gains
may increase the amount of the fees you will be required to pay us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate
the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the
decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange
rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
success of our hedging transactions will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currencies and interest rates. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks,
unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the
instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to (or be able to) establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and
the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations
affecting the value of securities denominated in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. </P>

to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the total return swap, which may include a specified security or loan, basket of securities or loans or securities or loan indices during the
specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. A total return swap is typically used to obtain exposure to a security, loan or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or loan
or investing directly in such market. A total return swap may effectively add leverage to our portfolio because, in addition to our total net assets, we would be subject to investment exposure on the amount of securities or loans subject to the
total return swap. A total return swap is also subject to the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations thereunder or that we will not be able to meet our obligations to the counterparty. In addition, because a total return
swap is a form of synthetic leverage, such arrangements are subject to risks similar to those associated with the use of leverage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are subject

publication on June&nbsp;30, 2023, no settings of LIBOR continue to be published on a representative basis and publication of many <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> dollar LIBOR settings has been entirely discontinued. On
July&nbsp;29, 2021, the Federal Reserve System (&#147;FRS&#148;), in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has begun publishing SOFR, which is their preferred
alternative rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, and which is a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. In April 2018, the Bank of England began publishing its proposed alternative rate, the Sterling Overnight
Index Average. Proposals for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced or have already begun publication. Further, on March&nbsp;15, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, which includes the Adjustable
Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, was signed into law in the United States. This legislation establishes a uniform benchmark replacement process for financial contracts that mature after June&nbsp;30, 2023 that do not contain clearly defined or practicable
fallback provisions. The legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to utilize a replacement rate recommended by the Board of Governors of the FRS. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority,
which regulates the publisher of LIBOR (ICE Benchmark Administration) has announced that it will require the continued publication of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-,</FONT> three- and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT>
tenors of U.S.-dollar LIBOR on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-representative</FONT> synthetic basis until the end of September 2024, which may result in certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT>
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">law-governed</FONT> contracts and U.S. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">law-governed</FONT> contracts not covered by the federal legislation remaining on synthetic U.S.-dollar LIBOR until the end of this period. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2023, primarily all of our debt instruments and any related hedging arrangements either included fallback language to address a LIBOR replacement or such agreements do not utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest
rate. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, the transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates have been complex and could have an adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of any changes in the pricing of our investments, changes to the documentation for certain of our investments and the pace of such changes, disputes and
other actions regarding the interpretation of current and prospective loan documentation or modifications to processes and systems. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our investment

our valuation designee. Subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors, the Adviser will value our investments, no less frequently than quarterly, including with the assistance of one or more
independent valuation firms. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair values of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#146;s ability to make payments and its
earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow, current market interest rates and other relevant factors. In connection with that determination, portfolio company
valuations will be prepared using different sources, including preliminary valuations obtained from independent valuation firms and/or proprietary models depending on the availability of information and the type of asset being valued, all in
accordance with the Adviser&#146;s valuation policy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The determination of fair value, and thus the amount of unrealized appreciation or depreciation we
may recognize in any reporting period, is to a degree subjective, and the Adviser has a conflict of interest in fair valuing our investments, as the Adviser&#146;s Management Fee is based in part on our gross assets. Because such valuations, and
particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, the valuations may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time due to changes in current market conditions. The determinations of fair value in
accordance with procedures established by our Board of Directors may differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market and market quotations existed for such investments. Volatile market conditions could also cause
reduced liquidity in the market for certain assets, which could result in liquidation values that are materially less than the values of such assets as reflected in net asset value. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if the
determinations regarding the fair value of the investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments. </P>

determined in good faith in accordance with procedures established by our Board of Directors. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments relative to amortized cost will be recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized
losses in our portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company&#146;s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected loans. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our
income available for distribution in future periods. In addition, decreases in the market value or fair value of our investments will reduce our net asset value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We will face competition for investment opportunities, which could delay further deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses.

and mezzanine funds) and other clients of the Adviser or its affiliates, as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Moreover, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds,
continue to increase their investment focus in our target market of privately owned U.S. companies. We may experience increased competition from banks and investment vehicles who may continue to lend to the middle market. Additionally, the Federal
Reserve and other bank regulators may periodically provide incentives to U.S. commercial banks to originate more loans to U.S. middle market private companies. As a result of these market participants and regulatory incentives, competition for
investment opportunities in privately owned U.S. companies is strong and may intensify. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may
have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than us. These characteristics could allow our competitors to
consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do. </P>

litigation may consume substantial amounts of the Adviser&#146;s and 26North&#146;s time and attention, and that time and the devotion of these resources to litigation may, at times, be disproportionate to the amounts at stake in the litigation. The
adoption of new or the enhancement of existing laws and regulations may further increase the risk of litigation. Any such litigation would likely have a negative financial impact on the Company. For instance, the expense of defending against claims

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Compliance with the applicable Privacy Laws may require adhering to stringent legal and operational
obligations and therefore the dedication of substantial time and financial resources by the Adviser, 26North, us and our portfolio companies, and/ or each of their affiliates, which may increase over time (in particular in relation to any transfers
of relevant personal data to third parties located in certain jurisdictions). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, failure to comply with the Privacy Laws may lead to the Adviser,
26North, us and our portfolio companies, and/or our affiliates incurring fines and/or suffering other enforcement action or reputational damage. For example, failure to comply with the GDPR, depending on the nature and severity of the breach (and
with a requirement on regulators to ensure any enforcement action taken is proportionate), could (in the worst case) attract regulatory penalties up to the greater of: (i)&nbsp;&#128;20&nbsp;million / &pound;17.5&nbsp;million (as applicable); and
(ii)&nbsp;4% of an entire group&#146;s total annual worldwide turnover, as well as the possibility of other enforcement actions (such as suspension of processing activities and audits), liabilities from third-party claims. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our United States operations in particular will be impacted by a growing movement to adopt comprehensive privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR,
where such laws focus on privacy as an individual right in general. For example, California has passed the CCPA, which took effect on January&nbsp;1, 2020. The CCPA generally applies to businesses that collect personal information about California
consumers, and either meet certain thresholds with respect to revenue or buying and/or selling consumers&#146; personal information. The CCPA imposes stringent legal and operational obligations on such businesses as well as certain affiliated
entities that share common branding. The CCPA is enforceable by the California Attorney General. Additionally, if unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of a consumer&#146;s personal information occurs, and the business did not maintain reasonable
security practices, consumers could file a civil action (including a class action) without having to prove actual damages. Statutory damages range from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater. The California
Attorney General also may impose civil penalties ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 per violation. Further, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the &#147;CPRA&#148;) to amend and extend the protections of the CCPA. When the CPRA
became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2023, California established a new state agency focused on the enforcement of its privacy laws, likely leading to greater levels of enforcement and greater costs related to compliance with the CCPA (and CPRA).
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other states in the United States, have either passed, proposed or are considering similar law and regulations to the GDPR and the CCPA (such as the
Nevada Privacy of Information Collected on the Internet from Consumers Act, which became effective on October&nbsp;1, 2021, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act passed March&nbsp;2, 2021, the Colorado Privacy Act passed on July&nbsp;8,
2021, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act passed on March&nbsp;24, 2022, and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act passed on May&nbsp;10, 2022, all of which became effective in 2023), which could impose similarly significant costs, potential liabilities and
operational and legal obligations. Such laws and regulations are expected to vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus increasing costs, operational and legal burdens, and the potential for significant liability on regulated entities. </P>

success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of the Adviser, including its key professionals. We cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen business, medical, personal or other circumstances would not lead
any such individual to terminate his or her relationship with us and/or the Adviser. The departure of a significant number of key professionals from the Adviser could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective.

Adviser may not be able to find qualified investment professionals in a timely manner or at all. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. The Adviser may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time, which will increase as the number of investments grow, may distract them or slow the rate of
investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Investment Advisory Agreement has a termination provision that allows the agreement to be terminated by us on 60 days&#146;
notice without penalty by the vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Shares of our Common Stock or by the vote of our Independent Directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement generally may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by the Adviser
upon 60 days&#146; notice to us. Furthermore, the Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Adviser. If the Adviser resigns or is terminated, or if we do not obtain the
requisite approvals of our Stockholders and the Board of Directors to approve an agreement with the Adviser after an assignment, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to
provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms prior to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption and costs under any new
agreements that we enter into could increase. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional
costs and time delays. Our financial condition, business and results of operations, as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under any indebtedness and to pay distributions, are likely to be adversely affected, and the value of our
Common Stock may decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Adviser depends on its relationships with corporations, financial institutions and investment firms, and we
will rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. If the Adviser fails to maintain its existing relationships or develop new relationships or sources of investment opportunities, we may
not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom the Adviser has relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate
investment opportunities for us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our fee structure may create a conflict of interest due to the incentives for the Adviser to make speculative
investments or use substantial leverage. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Incentive Fee payable by us to the Adviser may create an incentive for the Adviser to make
investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangements. These compensation arrangements could affect the Adviser&#146;s or its affiliates&#146; judgment with respect to
investments made by us, which allow the Adviser to earn increased Management Fees and Incentive Fees. The way in which the Incentive Fee is determined may encourage the Adviser to use leverage to increase the leveraged return on our investment
portfolio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the fact that our Management Fee is payable based upon our average gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents but including
assets purchased with borrowed amounts may encourage the Adviser to use leverage to make additional investments. Such a practice could make such investments riskier than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses,
particularly during cyclical economic downturns. Under certain circumstances, the use of substantial leverage (up to the limits prescribed by the 1940 Act) may increase the likelihood of our defaulting on our borrowings, which would be detrimental
to holders of our securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;catch-up&#148;</FONT> portion of the Incentive Fee may encourage our Adviser to

manage potential conflicts of interest in good faith, the portfolio strategies employed by the Adviser and its affiliates in managing its other funds and accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by the Adviser in
managing us and may affect the prices and availability of investments. The Adviser and its affiliates may, from time to time, give advice and make investment recommendations to other affiliate-managed investment vehicles that differ from advice
given to, or investment recommendations made to, us, even though their investment objective may be the same or similar to ours. Other affiliate-managed investment vehicles, whether now existing or created in the future, could compete with us for the
purchase and sale of investments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among us and other affiliated funds and accounts, the
ability of the Adviser to recommend such opportunities to us may be restricted by applicable laws or regulatory requirements (including under the 1940 Act) and the Adviser will allocate investment opportunities and realization opportunities between
us and other affiliated funds and accounts in a manner that is consistent with the adopted written investment allocation policies and procedures established by the Adviser and its affiliates, which may be amended from time to time, designed to
ensure allocations of opportunities are made over time on a fair and equitable basis. The outcome of any allocation determination by the Adviser and its affiliates may result in the allocation of all or none of an investment opportunity to us.
26North&#146;s allocation of investment opportunities among us and other affiliated investment funds and accounts in the manner discussed above may not result in proportional allocations, and such allocations may be more or less advantageous to some
relative to others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent the Company and such other funds and accounts invest in the same portfolio investments, actions taken by the Adviser or
its affiliates on behalf of such other funds and accounts may be adverse to us and our investments, which could harm our performance. For example, we may invest in the same credit obligations, although, to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act,
our investments may include different obligations or levels of the capital structure of the same issuer. Such investments may inherently give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest between or among the various classes of
securities that may be held. Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding our portfolio may benefit such funds and accounts. On the other hand, such funds and accounts may pursue or enforce rights with respect to one of our
portfolio companies, and those activities may have an adverse effect on us. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of our investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of such funds and accounts, and transactions for us
may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a conflict of interest
exists to the extent the Adviser, its affiliates, or any of their respective executives, portfolio managers or employees have proprietary or personal investments in other investment companies or accounts or when certain other investment companies or
accounts are investment options in the Adviser&#146;s or its affiliates&#146; employee benefit plans. In these circumstances, the Adviser has an incentive to favor these other investment companies or accounts over us. The Board of Directors will
seek to monitor these conflicts but there can be no assurances that such monitoring will fully mitigate any such conflicts. </P>

stability and reputation of the particular service provider, as well as other factors that the Adviser deems appropriate to consider under the circumstances. Service providers and financing sources may provide other services that are beneficial to
the Adviser and their affiliates, but that are not necessarily beneficial to us, including capital introductions, other marketing assistance, client and personnel referrals, consulting services, and research-related services. These other services

to the extent that we are required to pay the incentive fee on income with respect to such accrued income. As a result, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt

ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, equals at least 150% after such incurrence or
issuance. If we issue senior securities, we will be exposed to risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. Our ability to issue different types of securities is also limited. Compliance with RIC distribution requirements may
unfavorably limit our investment opportunities and reduce our ability in comparison to other companies to profit from favorable spreads between the rates at which we can borrow and the rates at which we can lend. Therefore, we intend to seek to
continuously issue equity securities, which may lead to Stockholder dilution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to recognize taxable
income (such as deferred interest that is accrued as original issue discount) in some circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash and to make distributions with respect to such income to maintain our status as a RIC.
Under such circumstances, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. This difficulty in making the required distribution may be amplified to the extent that we are
required to pay an incentive fee with respect to such accrued income. As a result, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, or forgo new
investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may not qualify for or maintain RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may borrow to fund investments. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act, which would
prohibit us from paying distributions and could prevent us from qualifying for tax treatment as a RIC, which would generally result in a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any income and net gains. If we cannot satisfy the asset coverage
test, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our debt financing, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we anticipate that as market conditions permit, we may securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we

investments, you will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to shares of our Common Stock to increase more sharply than it would
had we not leveraged our business. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income
would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make distributions or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock, make scheduled debt payments
or other payments related to our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. See &#147;<I> &#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We may borrow money, which may magnify the potential for gain or loss

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We invest in directly originated senior secured loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States. The Company&#146;s portfolio will consist
primarily of direct originations of (i)&nbsp;first lien senior secured debt and unitranche debt (including last out portions of such loans) and, to a lesser extent, (ii)&nbsp;second lien senior secured debt and unsecured debt, including mezzanine
debt. In connection with its debt investments the Company also may receive equity warrants or make select equity investments. The securities in which we invest typically are not rated by any rating agency, and if they were rated, they would be below
investment grade (rated lower than &#147;Baa3&#148; by Moody&#146;s Investors Service and lower than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;BBB-&#148;</FONT> by Fitch Ratings or S&amp;P). These securities, which may be referred to as &#147;junk
bonds,&#148; &#147;high yield bonds&#148; or &#147;leveraged loans,&#148; have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer&#146;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, some of the loans in which we may
invest may be &#147;covenant-lite&#148; loans. We use the term &#147;covenant-lite&#148; loans to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, &#147;covenant-lite&#148; loans provide
borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in
the borrower&#146;s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in &#147;covenant-lite&#148; loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or
exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. Therefore, our investments may result in an above-average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal. We also may invest in other assets, including U.S. government securities and
structured securities. These investments entail additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Secured
Debt.</I><I></I>&nbsp;When we make a secured debt investment, we generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of any subsidiaries, which we expect to help mitigate the risk that
we will not be repaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our debt investment may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the
success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors, such as trade creditors.
In addition, deterioration in a portfolio company&#146;s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the debt investment.
Consequently, the fact that our debt is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the debt investment&#146;s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan, in full or at all,
should we enforce our remedies. </P>

may lose all or part of the amounts advanced to the borrower or may be required to accept collateral with a value less than the amount of the loan advanced by us to the borrower. </P>

and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of a portfolio company to raise additional capital. If the underlying collateral value is less than the loan amount, we
will suffer a loss. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan&#146;s terms, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to
enforce our remedies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which

example, certain debt investments that we will make in portfolio companies will be secured on a second priority lien basis by the same collateral securing senior debt of such companies. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the
portfolio company&#146;s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under the agreements governing the debt. Also, in the event of insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, any holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any
distribution. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations secured by the first priority or second priority liens after payment in full of
all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the debt obligations secured by the first priority or second priority liens, then we, to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the portfolio company&#146;s remaining assets, if any. </P>

senior, first-lien debt. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies (through &#147;standstill&#148;

significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more
of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments, net of prepayment fees, could negatively impact our return on equity. This risk will be more acute when interest rates decrease, as we may be unable to

Management Fee,&nbsp;Incentive Fee, other expenses and distributions. Any working capital reserves we maintain may not be sufficient for investment purposes, and we may require additional debt financing or equity capital to operate. Pursuant to tax
rules&nbsp;that apply to RICs, we will be required to distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our Stockholders after we elect to be treated for tax
purposes as a RIC. Accordingly, in the event that we need additional capital in the future for investments or for any other reason we may need to access the capital markets periodically to issue debt or equity securities or borrow from financial
institutions in order to obtain such additional capital. These sources of funding may not be available to us due to unfavorable economic conditions, which could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a
decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. Consequently, if we cannot obtain further debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire additional investments and to expand our operations will be adversely affected. As a

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, investments in private companies tend to be less liquid. The securities of private companies are not publicly traded or actively traded on the
secondary market and are, instead, traded on a privately negotiated OTC secondary market for institutional investors. These OTC secondary markets may be inactive during an economic downturn or a credit crisis and in any event often have lower
volumes than publicly traded securities even in normal market conditions. In addition, the securities in these companies will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. If
there is no readily available market for these investments, we are required to carry these investments at fair value as determined by our Board of Directors. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we
may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we, the Adviser or any of
its affiliates have material nonpublic information regarding such portfolio company or where the sale would be an impermissible joint transaction under the 1940 Act. The reduced liquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of
them at a favorable price, and, as a result, we may suffer losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, little public information generally exists about private companies and these
companies may not have third-party credit ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of the Adviser to obtain adequate information through due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness and potential returns from
investing in these companies, and to monitor the activities and performance of these investments. To the extent that we (or other clients of the Adviser) may hold a larger number of investments, greater demands will be placed on the Adviser&#146;s
time, resources and personnel in monitoring such investments, which may result in less attention being paid to any individual investment and greater risk that our investment decisions may not be fully informed. Additionally, these companies and
their financial information will not generally be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules&nbsp;that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed
investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. </P>

holders of our Common Stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, convertible debt, or any combination of these securities. Holders of preferred stock or convertible debt may have

which could potentially adversely affect the interests of existing Stockholders. For example, the 1940 Act requires that holders of shares of preferred stock must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of
the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more, until such arrearage is eliminated. In addition, certain matters under the 1940 Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding
preferred stock, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">open-end</FONT> status and, accordingly, preferred stockholders could veto any such changes. Restrictions imposed on the
declarations and payment of distributions or dividends, as applicable, to the holders of our Common Stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to maintain our tax
treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stockholders will likely have conflicting interests with respect to their investments in

As a consequence, conflicts will from time to time arise in connection with decisions made by the Adviser regarding an investment that may be more beneficial to one Stockholder than another,
especially with respect to tax matters. The results of the Company&#146;s investment activities will affect individual Stockholders differently, depending on their different situations. In structuring and completing investments, the Adviser
generally will consider the investment and tax objectives of the Company and its Stockholders as a whole, not the investment, tax, or other objectives of any Stockholder individually. Thus, there can be no assurance that the structure of the Company
or any of its investments will be tax efficient for any particular Stockholder or that any particular tax result will be achieved. In particular, the risk of Stockholders being subject to tax inefficiencies, including taxation under controlled
foreign corporation rules&nbsp;in their jurisdiction, withholding tax or other taxation that may arise if certain requirements are not met, or tax timing disadvantages as a result of their participation in the Company may occur and will depend on

</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Annual Distribution Requirement for a RIC will be satisfied if we distribute to our Stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our
&#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses. In addition, a RIC may, in certain cases, satisfy
the 90% distribution requirement by disbursing distributions relating to a taxable year after the close of such taxable year under the &#147;spillback dividend&#148; provisions of Subchapter M. We would be taxed, at regular corporate rates, on
retained income and/or gains, including any short-term capital gains or long-term capital gains. Because we may use debt financing, we are subject to (i)&nbsp;an asset coverage ratio requirement under the 1940 Act and may, in the future, be subject
to (ii)&nbsp;certain financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements. If we are unable to obtain cash from other
sources, or choose or are required to retain a portion of our taxable income or gains, we could (1)&nbsp;be required to pay income and/or excise taxes or (2)&nbsp;fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment, and thus become subject to corporate-level
income tax on all our taxable income (including gains) regardless of whether or not such income and gains are distributed to Stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The income
source requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our annual income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or securities, net income derived from an interest in a
&#147;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#148; or other income derived from the business of investing in stock or securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The asset
diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. Specifically, at least 50% of the value of our assets must consist of cash, cash-equivalents
(including receivables), U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other acceptable securities if such securities or any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting
securities of the issuer; and no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined
under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Failure to meet these requirements may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most
of our investments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses. </P>

which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules&nbsp;as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK, secondary market purchases of debt securities at a
discount to par, interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of
whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as unrealized appreciation for foreign currency forward contracts and
deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> compensation such as warrants or stock. Furthermore, we may invest in
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> corporations (or other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that could be treated under the Code and U.S. Treasury
regulations as &#147;passive foreign investment companies&#148; and/or &#147;controlled foreign corporations.&#148; The rules&nbsp;relating to investment in these types of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> entities are designed to
ensure that U.S. taxpayers are either, in effect, taxed currently (or on an accelerated basis with respect to corporate-level events) or taxed at increased tax rates at distribution or disposition. In certain circumstances this could require us to
recognize income where we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unrealized appreciation on derivatives, such as foreign currency forward
contracts, may be included in taxable income while the receipt of cash may occur in a subsequent period when the related contract expires. Any unrealized depreciation on investments that the foreign currency forward contracts are designed to hedge
are not currently deductible for tax purposes. This can result in increased taxable income whereby we may not have sufficient cash to pay distributions or we may opt to retain such taxable income and pay a 4% excise tax. In such cases we could still
rely upon the &#147;spillback provisions&#148; to maintain RIC tax treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute OID or other
income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash. Further, we may elect to amortize market discounts with respect to debt securities acquired in the secondary market and include such amounts in our taxable income in the
current year, instead of upon disposition, as an election not to do so would limit our ability to deduct interest expenses for tax purposes. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the
year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our Stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even if we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting
the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, make a
partial share distribution, or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, and choose not to make a qualifying share distribution, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus
become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are not treated as a &#147;publicly offered regulated investment company,&#148; as

conditions and events, such as natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics, terrorism, conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the ongoing conflict(s) in the Middle East, and social unrest, create uncertainty and have
significant impacts on issuers, industries, governments and other systems, including the financial markets, to which companies and their investments are exposed. As global systems, economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected,
events that once had only local impact are now more likely to have regional or even global effects. Uncertainty can result in or coincide with, among other things: increased volatility in the financial markets for securities, derivatives, loans,
credit and currency; a decrease in the reliability of market prices and difficulty in valuing assets (including portfolio company assets); greater fluctuations in spreads on debt investments and currency exchange rates; increased risk of default (by
both government and private obligors and issuers); further social, economic, and political instability; nationalization of private enterprise; greater governmental involvement in the economy or in social factors that impact the economy; changes to
governmental regulation and supervision of the loan, securities, derivatives and currency markets and market participants and decreased or revised monitoring of such markets by governments or self-regulatory organizations and reduced enforcement of
regulations; limitations on the activities of investors in such markets; controls or restrictions on foreign investment, capital controls and limitations on repatriation of invested capital; the significant loss of liquidity and the inability to
purchase, sell and otherwise fund investments or settle transactions (including a market freeze); unavailability of currency hedging techniques; substantial, and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation, which can last many years and have
substantial negative effects on credit and securities markets as well as the economy as a whole; recessions; and difficulties in obtaining and/or enforcing legal judgments. </P>

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Russia&#146;s military invasion of Ukraine in February&nbsp;2022, the resulting responses by the United States and other countries, and the
potential for wider conflict could increase volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and adversely affect regional and global economies. The United States and other countries have imposed broad-ranging economic sanctions on Russia and
certain Russian individuals, banking entities and corporations as a response to its invasion of Ukraine. The United States and other countries have also imposed economic sanctions on Belarus and may impose sanctions on other countries that support
Russia&#146;s military invasion. These sanctions, as well as any other economic consequences related to the invasion, such as additional sanctions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences or cyberattacks on governments, companies or
individuals, may further decrease the value and liquidity of certain investments. To the extent that the Company has exposure to investments in countries affected by the invasion, the Company&#146;s ability to price, buy, sell, receive or deliver
such investments may be impaired. The extent and duration of Russia&#146;s military actions and the repercussions of such actions (including any retaliatory actions or countermeasures that may be taken by those subject to sanctions) are impossible
to predict, but could result in significant market disruptions, including in the oil and natural gas markets, and may negatively affect global supply chains, inflation and global growth. These and any related events could significantly impact the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our debt investments during these periods. In the
past, instability in the global capital markets resulted in disruptions in liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-pricing</FONT> of credit risk in the
broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major domestic and international financial institutions. In particular, in past periods of instability, the financial services sector was negatively impacted by significant write-offs as the value
of the assets held by financial firms declined, impairing their capital positions and abilities to lend and invest. In addition, continued uncertainty surrounding the prolonged economic impact of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19,</FONT> the
negotiation of trade deals between the UK and the EU following the UK&#146;s exit from the EU, uncertainty between the United States and other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, and tariffs, and the rising conflict

recession may further decrease the value of such collateral and result in losses of value in our portfolio and a decrease in our revenues, net income, assets and net worth. Unfavorable economic conditions, including rising interest rates, also could
increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us on terms we deem acceptable. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.

Distress Event. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An investment in the Company is subject to the risk that one of the banks, brokers, hedging counterparties, lenders or other
custodians (each, a &#147;Financial Institution&#148;) of some or all of the Company&#146;s (or any portfolio company&#146;s) assets fails to timely perform its obligations or experiences insolvency, closure, receivership or other financial distress
or difficulty (each, a &#147;Distress Event<B>&#148;</B>). Distress Events can be caused by factors including eroding market sentiment, significant withdrawals, fraud, malfeasance, poor performance or accounting irregularities. If a Financial
Institution experiences a Distress Event, the Adviser, the Company or one of its portfolio companies may not be able to access deposits, borrowing facilities or other services, either permanently or for an extended period of time. Although assets
held by regulated Financial Institutions in the United States frequently are insured up to stated balance amounts by organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), in the case of banks, and the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC), in the case of certain broker-dealers, amounts in excess of the relevant insurance are subject to risk of total loss, and any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> Financial Institutions that are not subject to similar
regimes pose increased risk of loss. While in recent years governmental intervention has often resulted in additional protections for depositors and counterparties during Distress Events, there can be no assurance that such intervention will occur
in a future Distress Event or that any such intervention undertaken will be successful or avoid the risks of loss, substantial delays or negative impact on banking or brokerage conditions or markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any Distress Event has a potentially adverse effect on the ability of the Adviser to manage the Company&#146;s investments, and on the ability of the Adviser,
the Administrator, the Company and any portfolio company to maintain operations, which in each case could result in significant losses and in unconsummated investment acquisitions and dispositions. Such losses could include: a loss of funds; an
obligation to pay fees and expenses in the event the Company is not able to close a transaction (whether due to the inability to draw capital on a credit line provided by a Financial Institution experiencing a Distress Event, the inability of the
Company to access capital contributions or otherwise); the inability of the Company to acquire or dispose of investments, or acquire or dispose of such investments at prices that the Adviser believes reflect the fair value of such investments; and
the inability of portfolio companies to make payroll, fulfill obligations or maintain operations. If a Distress Event leads to a loss of access to a Financial Institution&#146;s services, it is also possible that the Company or a portfolio company
will incur additional expenses or delays in putting in place alternative arrangements or that such alternative arrangements will be less favorable than those formerly in place (with respect to economic terms, service levels, access to capital, or
otherwise). To the extent the Adviser is able to exercise contractual remedies under agreements with Financial Institutions in the event of a Distress Event, there can be no assurance that such remedies will be successful or avoid losses, delays or
other impacts. The Company and its portfolio companies are subject to similar risks if a Financial Institution utilized by investors in the Company or by suppliers, vendors, service providers or other counterparties of the Company or a portfolio
company becomes subject to a Distress Event, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many Financial Institutions require, as a
condition to using their services (including lending services), that the Adviser and/or the Company maintain all or a set amount or percentage of their respective accounts or assets with the Financial Institution, which heightens the risks
associated with a Distress Event with respect to such Financial Institutions. The Adviser is under no obligation to use a minimum number of Financial Institutions with respect to the Company or to maintain account balances at or below the relevant
insured amounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, Distress Events such as the current turmoil of the U.S. banking system raise fears of broader financial contagion, and it is

unwilling or significantly less willing to finance new investments or to offer less favorable terms than had been prevailing in the recent past. The tightening of availability of credit to businesses generally could lead to an overall weakening of
the U.S. and global economies, which in turn is likely to adversely affect the ability of the Company to sell or liquidate investments at favorable times or at favorable prices or otherwise have an adverse effect on the business and operations of
the Company. In addition, valuations of the Company&#146;s investments are subject to heightened uncertainty as the result of market volatility and disruption. To the extent the Company is unable to obtain favorable financing terms for its portfolio
investments or sell investments on favorable terms, the Company&#146;s ability to generate attractive investment returns for its Stockholders is expected to be adversely affected. </P>

reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, including, but not limited to diversity, equity and inclusion, human rights, climate change and environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance,
transparency and consideration of ESG factors in our investment processes. Adverse incidents or other developments with respect to ESG matters could impact the value of our brand, our relationship with existing and future portfolio companies, the
cost of our operations and relationships with investors, or have a material effect on the return and risk profile of our investments, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, there is no guarantee that the Adviser&#146;s responsible investment practices will reflect the beliefs or values, internal policies or preferred
practices of any particular Stockholder or other asset managers or reflect market trends for all ESG considerations across geographies and investor types. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Conversely, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">anti-ESG</FONT> sentiment also has gained momentum across the U.S., with several states and Congress having
proposed or enacted <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;anti-ESG&#148;</FONT> policies, legislation or initiatives and certain states having issued related legal guidance and advisory opinions. Additionally, asset managers have been subject to
recent scrutiny related to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ESG-focused</FONT> industry working groups, initiatives and associations, including organizations advancing action to address climate change or climate-related risk. Such scrutiny could
expose us or our Adviser to the risk of antitrust investigations or challenges by state or federal authorities, result in reputational harm, require certain investors to divest or discourage certain investors from investing in 26North Funds. If we
do not successfully manage expectations across varied stakeholder interests, it could erode stakeholder trust, impact our reputation and constrain our investment opportunities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, considering ESG factors when evaluating an investment in certain circumstances could, to the extent material risks associated with an investment are
identified, cause the Adviser not to make an investment that it would have made or to make a management decision with respect to an investment differently than it would have made in the absence of such consideration, which carries the risk that the
Company could perform differently than investment funds that do not take ESG factors into account. Additionally, ESG factors are only some of the many factors that the Adviser expects to consider in making an investment. The Adviser cannot guarantee
that the consideration of ESG factors or engagement with portfolio companies with respect to ESG factors, which will include qualitative judgments, will positively impact the performance of any individual investment or the Company as a whole. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The materiality of ESG risks and impacts on an individual asset or issuer and on a portfolio as a whole depends on many factors, including the relevant
industry, location, asset class and investment style. In evaluating a prospective investment&#146;s ESG practices, the Adviser may depend upon information and data provided by the entity or obtained via third-party reporting or advisors, which could
be incomplete or inaccurate and could cause the Adviser to incorrectly identify, prioritize, assess or analyze the entity&#146;s ESG practices and/or related risks and </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, new regulatory initiatives related to ESG that are applicable to us, the Adviser, or our portfolio companies could adversely affect our
business. Finally, there is also growing regulatory interest, particularly in the U.S., UK, and EU (which may be looked to as models in growth markets), in improving transparency around how asset managers define and measure ESG performance, in order
to allow investors to validate and better understand sustainability claims. In 2021, the SEC established an enforcement task force to review ESG practices and disclosures by public companies and investment managers, and has started to bring
enforcement actions based on mismatches of ESG disclosures and actual investment processes. Further, in 2022, the SEC issued a proposed rule regarding the enhancement and standardization of mandatory climate-related disclosures for investors that
would mandate extensive disclosure of climate-related data, risks, and opportunities for certain public companies. In addition, the SEC has announced that it is working on proposals that would mandate disclosure of certain <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ESG-related</FONT> matters, including with respect to board diversity and human capital management. At this time, there is uncertainty regarding the scope of such proposals, the timing thereof and when, if ever, they could
become effective. The Adviser&#146;s ESG practices and the Adviser could become subject to additional regulation in the future, and the Adviser cannot guarantee that its current approach or the Company&#146;s investments will meet future regulatory
requirements or predict the manner in which any such future requirements (including any enforcement with respect thereto) could affect the Company or its investments, including with respect to future administrative burdens and costs. Moreover, there
is a risk that a significant reorientation in the market following the implementation of these and further measures could be adverse to our portfolio companies if they are perceived to be less valuable as a consequence of, for example, their carbon
footprint or &#147;greenwashing&#148;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="txa640554_3"></A>ITEM&#8201;1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each of the Company, 26North and our industry generally is highly dependent on information systems and technology and as a result, could be prone to
cybersecurity threats and attacks. In response, 26North maintains a cybersecurity program that includes policies and controls designed to mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and
threats that are not fully mitigated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of its overall risk management efforts, 26North has developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk
management program (the &#147;RMP&#148;) that applies to our business and operations. The RMP is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the critical systems involved in our business and the information stored in those
systems. The RMP leverages a combination of standards and best practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, the International Organization for Standardization, and the Center for Internet Security, among
others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">26North utilizes technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems, tools and related services, including from
third-party providers, and management oversight to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. In addition, 26North has implemented and continues to implement risk-based controls designed to prevent, detect and respond to
information security threats. Such controls help us and 26North protect our information, our information systems, and the information of our investors, and other third parties who entrust us with their sensitive information. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An independent third-party also assesses and reports on 26North&#146;s internal incident response preparedness, adherence to best practices and industry
frameworks, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The external independent third-party helps identify areas for continued focus and improvement. Finally, 26North carries cyber security insurance that provides a level of financial
protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. However, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover or be sufficient to cover all losses or claims that may result from a cybersecurity incident. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">26North has also developed an incident response plan that provides guidelines for preparing for, responding to and recovering from cybersecurity incidents,
and facilitates coordination across multiple operational functions. The incident response plan includes processes to triage, assess severity, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate the incident, as well as to comply with potentially
applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage. The incident response plan includes notification to the applicable members of 26North&#146;s technology leadership team, including 26North&#146;s Chief Financial Officer
(&#147;CFO&#148;) and Chief Technology Officer (&#147;CTO&#148;), and, as appropriate, escalation to an internal <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ad-hoc</FONT> group of senior employees, tasked with helping to manage the cybersecurity incident.
Depending on their nature, incidents may also be reported to the Risk Committee (as defined below) or the board of directors of 26North, as well as to our Chief Compliance Officer, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and to our full Board
of Directors, if appropriate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our commencement of operations, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced
undetected cybersecurity incidents. Past or future incidents could have a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. For additional information about these risks, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148; in
this Annual Report. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight and has primary responsibility for oversight and review of
guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including cybersecurity. The leadership team at 26North has delegated oversight of cybersecurity and related risks to a committee (the &#147;Risk Committee&#148;). The Risk
Committee is a cross-functional committee that governs and oversees the RMP. The Risk Committee includes members of 26North&#146;s senior executive team, including its CFO, CTO, Chief Compliance Officer and senior partners from 26North&#146;s legal,
operations, finance, investment and strategy teams. The Risk Committee, will, through regular consultation with 26North&#146;s internal cybersecurity team assess, discuss, and prioritize the approach to high-level risks, mitigative controls, and
ongoing cybersecurity efforts. Further, our Chief Compliance Officer works closely with 26North&#146;s CTO to monitor ongoing cybersecurity threats and provide regular updates to our Board of Directors. </P>

first portfolio company investment. We are externally managed by our Adviser, 26North Direct Lending LP, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. As an externally managed BDC, we do not have any employees, and
our investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay the Adviser for investment and
management services pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 26North Direct Lending Administration LLC serves as our Administrator. The Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate pursuant to the
Administration Agreement. The Administrator has entered into a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-administration</FONT> agreement with SEI pursuant to which SEI will receive compensation for its services. </P>

loans) and, to a lesser extent, (ii)&nbsp;second lien senior secured debt and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt. In connection with its debt investments, the Company is permitted to receive equity warrants or make select equity <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-investments.</FONT> We generally consider middle market companies to consist of companies with between $25&nbsp;million and $100&nbsp;million of annual EBITDA, although the Company may from time to time invest in larger
or smaller companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we invest primarily in middle market companies domiciled in the United States, we also may from time to time invest, to a

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Adviser monitors on an ongoing basis, the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its
respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:
(i)&nbsp;assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company&#146;s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii)&nbsp;periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor
to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii)&nbsp;comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv)&nbsp;attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies;
and (v)&nbsp;review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the monitoring process,
our Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than
quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also
take into account in certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company&#146;s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: </P>

provisions under the 1940 Act and contained in any applicable indenture and related supplements. In addition, in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we may declare a significant portion of our dividends in shares
of our Common Stock instead of in cash. A Stockholder generally would be subject to tax on 100% of the fair market value of the dividend on the date the dividend is received by the Stockholder in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though a

current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such excess. Any such carryover income must be distributed before the end of the next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return

preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Investments at Fair Value </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One of the critical accounting
estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance
with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of
fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 1&#151;Valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 2&#151;Valuations based on quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3&#151;Valuations based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Transfers between levels, if any, will be recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in
investment valuations, the Adviser will apply a valuation policy approved by the Board of Directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Adviser will evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in
which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker
quotes), the Adviser will subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify </P>

for treatment as a Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3 investment. For example, the Adviser, or the independent valuation firm(s), will review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in
order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair
value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have
been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to
contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.

net asset value shall be determined as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sunday and holidays, next preceding the time of such determination). Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these
records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Investment Valuation Process </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The determination of the fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. As part of the valuation process, the Adviser will take into account relevant
factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company&#146;s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any
collateral, the portfolio company&#146;s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company&#146;s securities to any similar publicly traded
securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or
subsequent equity sale occurs, the Adviser will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Adviser will

and, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, appointed Wendell E. Pritchett as a Class&nbsp;III director of the Company, the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. These investments will generally not have a
readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as the Board of Directors&#146; valuation designee, in accordance with our valuation policy and procedures established by
our Board of Directors. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing
a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such
differences could be material. See Note 2 &#147;<I>Summary of Significant Account Policies</I>&#148; to our consolidated financial statements for more details on estimates and judgments made by us in connection with the valuation of our investments.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Because we have borrowed, and may from time to time borrow, money to make
investments, our net investment income will depend in part upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a
significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We regularly measure our
exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate-sensitive assets to our interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine
whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2023, 100.0% of
investments at fair value (excluding unfunded debt investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and none of our investments at fair value represent fixed-rate
investments. Additionally, our senior secured revolving credit facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR rates and prime interest rates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses, should interest rates increase by 50, 100,
150 or 200 basis points, or decrease by 50, 100, 150 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on December&nbsp;31, 2023. Interest expense is calculated based on the
terms of our outstanding revolving credit facilities. For our floating rate credit facilities, we use the outstanding balance as of December&nbsp;31, 2023. Interest expense on our floating rate credit facilities is calculated using the interest rate
as of December&nbsp;31, 2023, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of
December&nbsp;31, 2023. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of December&nbsp;31, 2023, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table (amounts in thousands). </P>

changes in net assets, cash flows, and the financial highlights for the period from October&nbsp;1, 2023 (period beginning after the date of the financial statements included in the Registration Statement on Form 10) to December&nbsp;31, 2023, in

assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements and financial highlights, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and financial highlights. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and financial
highlights. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December&nbsp;31, 2023, by correspondence with the custodian, loan agents, and borrowers. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">U.S. GAAP for an investment company requires investments to be recorded at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair
Value Measurements (&#147;ASC 820&#148;), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date, and
Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2a-5</FONT> under the 1940 Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such
prices or parameters when such quotations are readily available. In accordance with Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2a-5</FONT> under the 1940 Act, a market quotation is &#147;readily available&#148; only when it is a quoted price (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical instruments that a fund can access at the measurement date, provided that such a quotation is not considered to be readily available if it is not reliable. The Company utilizes
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-market</FONT> pricing (i.e., <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-point</FONT> of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. These market quotations are obtained from independent pricing services, if
available; otherwise generally from at least two principal market makers or primary market dealers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where prices or inputs are not available or, in the
judgment of the Board, not reliable, valuation techniques based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is
dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments&#146; complexity. In the absence of observable, reliable market prices, the Company values its investments using various valuation methodologies applied on a
consistent basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Market Approach </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Transaction prices quoted by exchanges are generally deemed to be the most reliable evidence of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and shall be used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available. The use of transaction prices is consistent with the market approach. ASC 820 defines the
market approach as, &#147;a valuation approach that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable (that is, similar) assets or liabilities.&#148; Our Adviser will apply the market
approach as the preferred valuation methodology unless another approach is deemed to be more appropriate. It is noted, however, that quoted transaction prices need to be from a sufficiently active market that can sustain the quantity of an
investment held by the Company. If the valuation committee determines that the transaction prices are not from an active market or are in quantities that are not comparable to the amounts owned by the Company, then the exchange price may be
disregarded in favor of a more appropriate method. Our Adviser seeks to stay informed of the creation of new markets or the occurrence of private transactions that would be relevant to the fair value of investments held by the Company. However, due
to the nature of these private market transactions, our Adviser will not always become aware of such developments. Our Adviser will incorporate relevant market transaction information and other relevant data points into the valuation of assets and
liabilities from the point in time when it becomes aware of the new information. Such data points will generally not be retroactively applied to prior period valuations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Income Approach </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As an alternative to the
market approach, the income approach may be used to value equity investments in private companies where recent observable market transactions are not available. The income approach converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and
expenses) to a single current (that is generally discounted) amount. When the income approach is used, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about those future amounts. While the market approach is preferred as the most
reliable indication of fair value, certain of the Company&#146;s investments may require alternative valuation methodologies if an observable market transaction has not occurred for an extended period of time. </P>

value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment&#146;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Adviser&#146;s assessment of the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar

significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, </P>

distributes at least annually to its stockholders (&#147;Stockholders&#148;) as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company would represent obligations of the Company&#146;s investors and would not be

income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its Stockholders. Distributions to Stockholders are recorded on the record date. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on the
Company&#146;s earnings, financial condition, maintenance of the Company&#146;s tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of Stockholders, unless a
Stockholder elects to receive cash distributions. As a result, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then the Stockholders who have not &#145;opted out&#146; of the dividend
reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stockholders who receive dividends and other distributions in the form of stock are generally subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax
consequences as Stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash. Since a participating Stockholder&#146;s cash distributions will be reinvested, however, such Stockholder will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes on
reinvested distributions. A Stockholder&#146;s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend or other distribution from the Company will generally be equal to the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to
the Stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend or other distribution will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the Stockholder&#146;s account. </P>
